# Swim the Charles River: Analyzing Safe-for-Swim Days in Boston's main urban river.

This project analyzes the water quality of the Charles River to determine safe 
swimming days and investigates the correlation between rainfall in Boston and 
river water quality. Inspired by initiatives like the 
[Charles River Swimming Club](https://www.charlesriverswimmingclub.org/) and
the [Charles River Swim Park Project](https://thecharles.org/swim-park-project/)
in Boston, as well as the [Plus Pool](https://pluspool.com/pool/design/) and 
[River Keeper](https://www.riverkeeper.org/) in New York, this study aims to 
provide insights into the feasibility of year-round swimming in the Charles River.
