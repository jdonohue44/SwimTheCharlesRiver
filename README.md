# Swim the Charles River: Analyzing Safe-for-Swim Days in Boston's Primary Urban River.

## About

This project analyzes cyanobacteria levels in Boston's Charles River between 2021 and 2024 to determine the number of safe swimming days. Secondarily, it investigates the correlation between rainfall in Boston and 
river water quality, a common deterrent to swimming in urban waters.
