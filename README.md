## Objective
Urban waterways have long been considered too polluted for swimming, but a growing movement is challenging this perception. Rivers like the Charles in Boston and the Hudson in New York are now the focus of ambitious revitalization efforts aimed at restoring water quality and public swimming access. This investigation examines the swimmability of the Charles River, as well as the factors affecting urban water systems, such as sewage infrastructure, industrial runoff, and rainfall. By analyzing these critical elements, the research seeks to assess the current state of urban river water quality and the potential for safe recreational use.

## Data
The research draws on comprehensive water quality data from multiple authoritative sources. The EPA's Charles River monitoring program provides live water quality measurements and buoy data, offering real-time insights into river conditions. The Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA) contributes additional water quality datasets, enhancing the depth of environmental analysis. Save the Harbor's annual report card will provide comparative urban water quality metrics. To contextualize environmental conditions, weather data from Visual Crossing will be integrated to correlate water quality with meteorological factors, enabling a more nuanced understanding of urban river ecosystem dynamics.
