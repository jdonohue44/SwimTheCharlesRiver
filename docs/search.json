These nutrients often come from industrial and wastewater treatment plants, septic tanks, stormwater runoff, and nutrient-rich rainfall. The most common type of HAB is cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria levels are the focus of this analysis.",

    "text": "Incorporate Fecal Bacteria Monitoring\nTo enhance the assessment of water safety, it is crucial to collect fecal bacteria data, either through remote sensors or manual sampling. Fecal contamination is commonly monitored using enterococci, an EPA-approved indicator of disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. These pathogens pose significant health risks, including gastrointestinal, skin, eye, ear, and respiratory infections. Ingesting fish or shellfish from contaminated waters can also lead to foodborne illnesses. Including fecal bacteria in the analysis would provide a more comprehensive picture of water quality, especially following rainfall events when contamination levels may spike.\nConduct Qualitative Research on Swimmer Perceptions\nUnderstanding the perceptions of local swimmers can offer valuable insights into the barriers to river recreation and public health concerns. A qualitative survey of urban swimmers in Boston should address key questions such as:\n\nHow do swimmers perceive the quality of water in the Charles River?\n\nWhat are the main deterrents that prevent swimmers from using the river for recreation?\nThis information will help refine safety advisories, promote community engagement, and guide future river management strategies to improve public confidence and access.",
