The sensors on the buoy are located 1 meter below the water’s surface. The data are transmitted in real-time using telemetry for remote access. The data from this buoy is used to assess water quality conditions and to help track cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms.\nVisual Crossing Historical Weather Data API (2024): Visual Crossing is a provider of weather data and enterprise analysis tools to data scientists, business analysts, professionals, and academics.
