    "text": "1 Introduction\nMaking urban waters more accessible to swimmers is a growing trend, with several initiatives underway in Boston and New York: Boston Charles River Swimming Club, Boston Charles River Swim Park Project, New York East River Plus Pool, and New York Hudson River Keeper.\nTo support the revitalization of urban rivers as recreational spaces, this report analyzes cyanobacteria levels in Boston’s Charles River to identify the number of safe swimming days throughout the year. Additionally, it explores the correlation between rainfall and cyanobacteria, a common deterrent for open water swimming.",

The sensors on the buoy are located 1 meter below the water’s surface. The data are transmitted in real-time using telemetry for remote access. The data from this buoy is used to assess water quality conditions and to help track cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms.\nVisual Crossing Historical Weather Data API (2024): Visual Crossing is a provider of weather data and enterprise analysis tools to data scientists, business analysts, professionals, and academics. Founded in 2003, this weather data API leads the industry by providing the lowest-cost access to all types of historical weather data, weather forecasts, climate summaries, and historical weather forecasts.",
