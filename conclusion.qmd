# Conclusion
In 2024, XX% of June and July were safe for swimming.
Rainfall and cyanobacteria levels were not strongly correlated, suggesting that this relationship may be overexaggerated. 

## Future Work
- Qualitative research / survey data on what locals think of the water quality and reasons to swim/not swim in the river.
- Hudson river buoy analysis through Riverkeeper program to expand this analysis.
