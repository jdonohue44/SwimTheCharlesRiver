# Conclusion
In the 2024 season, cyanobacteria levels in the Charles River exhibited notable variability, with 51 days (34%) categorized as low risk, 41 days (27%) as medium risk, and 58 days (39%) as high risk. The data also indicated that cyanobacteria levels tended to increase over the course of the summer, suggesting a seasonal shift where early summer presents a lower risk for swimming compared to late summer.

Interestingly, rainfall did not show a significant correlation with cyanobacteria levels. The Spearman correlation coefficient was low (-0.29), indicating a weak negative relationship, which deviates from expected trends. This suggests that factors other than precipitation—such as nutrient levels and water temperature—are more influential in shaping cyanobacteria dynamics in the river. Rainfall may be more closely linked to the runoff of fecal bacteria, a factor not included in this analysis but one that warrants attention, particularly since wet weather is known to exacerbate contamination risks.

Historical analysis of 2021-2023 showed that 2024 was an exceptional year for cyanobacteria levels. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, the percentage of low risk days was much higher than 2024 with 71%, 54%, and 82% low risk days in the season, respectively. Additionally, there were zero high risk days between 2021 and 2023.This suggests that overall safe-for-swim days may be closer to 60%, and that 2024 was an outlier year.  

Given the current limitations of the Charles River buoy monitoring system, which does not measure fecal bacteria such as Enterococci, it is crucial to incorporate this data moving forward. Assessing fecal contamination, especially following rainfall events, is an essential next step to providing comprehensive swim safety advisories. Future studies should focus on expanding our understanding of how both microbial and environmental factors interact to influence water quality and public health in urban water bodies.

## Future Work
1. **Incorporate Fecal Bacteria Monitoring.** To enhance the assessment of water safety, it is crucial to collect fecal bacteria data, either through remote sensors or manual sampling. Fecal contamination is commonly monitored using enterococci, an EPA-approved indicator of disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. These pathogens pose significant health risks, including gastrointestinal, skin, eye, ear, and respiratory infections. Ingesting fish or shellfish from contaminated waters can also lead to foodborne illnesses. Including fecal bacteria in the analysis would provide a more comprehensive picture of water quality, especially following rainfall events when contamination levels may spike.
2. **Conduct Qualitative Research on Swimmer Perceptions.** Understanding the perceptions of local swimmers can offer valuable insights into the barriers to river recreation and public health concerns. A qualitative survey of urban swimmers in Boston should address key questions such as:  
   - How do swimmers perceive the quality of water in the Charles River?  
   - What are the main deterrents that prevent swimmers from using the river for recreation? 
3. **Investigate more historical years of cyanobacteria data and their correlation with rainfall data.**
