# Conclusion
In 2024, there were 51 safe-for-swim days (34%) between May and October based on cyanobacteria levels, and rainfall was not strongly correlated with cyanobacteria levels.

However, the Charles River buoy does not currently monitor fecal bacteria levels (e.g. Enterococci) and wet weather is a known trigger of fecal contamination which can make water unsafe for swimming. Understanding the levels of fecal bacteria from sewage contamination is an essential next step before advising on swim water safety in the Charles River.

## Future Work
1. **Collect fecal bacteria data, either through remote sensors or manual sampling.** Certain microorganisms found in fecal matter (e.g. enterococci) are an EPA-approved fecal contamination indicator useful for detecting the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. These pathogens can sicken swimmers and others who use rivers and streams for recreation or eat raw shellfish or fish. Other potential health effects can include diseases of the skin, eyes, ears and respiratory tract. Eating fish or shellfish harvested from waters with fecal contamination can also result in human illness.
2. **Conduct a qualitative research survey on swimmers living in Boston**. Key questions to answer:
  - How do urban swimmers perceive their local urban river water quality?
  - What are the top deterrents preventing swimmers from swimming in the Charles River?
