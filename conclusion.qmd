# Conclusion
In 2024, XX% of June and July days were safe for swimming based on cyanobacteria levels. Additionally, rainfall and cyanobacteria levels were not strongly correlated.

However, the Charles River buoy does not currently monitor fecal bacteria levels (e.g. Enterococci) and wet weather is a known trigger of fecal contamination which can make water unsafe for swimming. Further analysis on enterococci levels is needed before advising on swim water safety in the Charles River.

## Future Work
1. **Conduct a qualitative research survey on urban swimmers** to learn: 1/what urban swimmers think of their local urban river water quality, and 2/top deterrents for swimming in local urban waters more often.
2. **Add fecal matter monitoring to the Charles River buoy.** Certain microorganisms found in fecal matter (e.g. enterococci) are an EPA-approved fecal contamination indicator useful for detecting the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. These pathogens can sicken swimmers and others who use rivers and streams for recreation or eat raw shellfish or fish. Other potential health effects can include diseases of the skin, eyes, ears and respiratory tract. Eating fish or shellfish harvested from waters with fecal contamination can also result in human illness.
