# Introduction

Making urban waters more accessible to swimmers is a growing trend, with several initiatives underway in Boston and New York: [Boston Charles River Swimming Club](https://www.charlesriverswimmingclub.org/), [Boston Charles River Swim Park Project](https://thecharles.org/swim-park-project/), [Boston City Splash](https://thecharles.org/city-splash/), [New York East River Plus Pool](https://pluspool.com/pool/design/), and [New York Hudson River Keeper](https://www.riverkeeper.org/).
 
To support the revitalization of urban rivers as recreational spaces, this report analyzes cyanobacteria levels in Boston's Charles River to help identify the number of safe swimming days throughout the year.

# Top Biological Risks with Urban Open Water Swimming

Overexposure to cyanobacteria or fecal microorganisms coming from sewage runoff can lead to gastroenteritis, infections, dysentery, and other medical risks.

## Algal Blooms

1. **Cyanobacteria (this analysis)**: Often referred to as blue-green algae, certain species can produce toxins harmful to humans.

## Sewage Contamination from Human Fecal Matter

1. **Enterococci**: High levels of these bacteria indicate fecal contamination and are associated with an increased risk of illness from water-contact activities.
2. **Escherichia coli (E. coli)**: Often found in urban waters due to sewage contamination, E. coli can cause gastrointestinal illness.
3. **Shigella**: This bacteria family can be spread through fecal contamination and cause gastrointestinal illnesses.
