# Introduction

Making urban waters more accessible to swimmers is a growing trend, with several initiatives underway in Boston and New York: [Boston Charles River Swimming Club](https://www.charlesriverswimmingclub.org/), [Boston Charles River Swim Park Project](https://thecharles.org/swim-park-project/), [New York East River Plus Pool](https://pluspool.com/pool/design/), and [New York Hudson River Keeper](https://www.riverkeeper.org/).
 
To support the revitalization of urban rivers as recreational spaces, this report analyzes cyanobacteria levels in Boston's Charles River to identify the number of safe swimming days throughout the year. Additionally, it explores the correlation between rainfall and cyanobacteria, a common deterrent for open water swimming.
