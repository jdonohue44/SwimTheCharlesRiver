# Introduction

Making urban waters more accessible to swimmers is a growing trend, with several initiatives underway in Boston and New York:

 - [Charles River Swimming Club](https://www.charlesriverswimmingclub.org/)
 - [Charles River Swim Park Project](https://thecharles.org/swim-park-project/)
 - [Plus Pool](https://pluspool.com/pool/design/)
 - [River Keeper](https://www.riverkeeper.org/)

This project seeks to analyze the water quality of Boston's Charles River to identify safe swimming days throughout the year. Additionally, it aims to explore the potential correlation between rainfall in Boston and the water quality of the Charles River on subsequent days. Understanding the safety of the Charles River for swimming supports the vision of urban rivers as vibrant, accessible recreational spaces. By identifying safe swimming days and understanding the impact of rainfall on water quality, this project aims to provide valuable insights for urban swimmers and policymakers.

# Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Pre-processing**: Gathering and cleaning data from the aforementioned sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigating patterns and trends in the data to identify potential safe swimming days.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationship between rainfall events and subsequent changes in water quality.
4. **Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
