## Data Sources

### **[Water Quality Buoy placed in the Lower Charles River](https://www.epa.gov/charlesriver/live-water-quality-data-lower-charles-river)**

Every 15 minutes, this self-contained solar powered buoy takes measurements for temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll, and phycocyanin. The sensors on the buoy are located 1 meter below the water's surface. The data are transmitted in real-time using telemetry for remote access. The data from this buoy is used to assess water quality conditions and to help track cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms.

## Missing Data Analysis

1. Fecal bacteria data is not recorded by the Charles River Buoy (e.g. enterococci samples).
2. Peak COVID pandemic years are missing data reporting by the Charles River Buoy (2020-2021).
